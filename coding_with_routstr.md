# Roo Code and Goose Shine when Coding with Freedom AI Tech

If using Cursor or Claude Code while billing it to your credit card is the gold standard for AI coding if you don't mind using your real identity and being spied upon, Roo Code and Goose plugging into Routstr is the gold standard if you are Satoshi and want to stay private. 

In this post, I'll guide you through the simple processing of setting up your coding enviroment with VSCode (+Roo Code), a terminal (+Goose) and Bitcoin with the help of Routstr.  

## Coding in VSCode with Roo Code
Before you open VSCode, create a cashu token worth 5k sats (recommended) and have it ready. Here is how you can get started: 
1. Install [Roo Code](https://roocode.com/) from the VSCode Extensions Marketplace. 
2. 
## No Emails, No Sign-ups, Just Cashu & Lightning
You can use any of the top LLMs via Routstr by inputting https://api.routstr.com/ and an API Key into Roo Code or Goose. Similar to using it via OpenRouter minus the need to sign up using email or having to top up using Fiat or the Coinbase chain. Here are the steps in more details: 
(Skip to step 4 if you already have a cashu wallet)
1. Setup a Cashu wallet (cashu.me or others)
2. Deposit some sats using Bitcoin Lightning (at least 5k sats for top models)
3. Create a cashu token (at least 5k sats, but 10 sats is also fine if you want to use 8b models)
4. Voila! That's it. Your cashu token is your API key. 
You just need an API key to plug into your AI clients. To get this API key, all you need to do is to generate a Cashu token using one of the Cashu wallets. If you don't have a Cashu wallet yet, install one, and receive Bitcoin via Lightning. I'd recommend cashu.me and the minibits mint. The amount depends on the 

## Introducing Goose: Your On-Machine AI Agent

While this article focuses on VSCode extensions, it's important to introduce **Goose**. Goose is a local, extensible, open-source AI agent designed to automate complex engineering tasks from start to finish. It's more than just code suggestions; Goose can build entire projects from scratch, write and execute code, debug failures, orchestrate workflows, and interact with external APIs â€” autonomously.

Goose works with any LLM and supports multi-model configuration to optimize performance and cost. It seamlessly integrates with MCP servers and is available as both a desktop app and a CLI. Whether you're prototyping an idea, refining existing code, or managing intricate engineering pipelines, Goose adapts to your workflow and executes tasks with precision. You can configure Goose to use Routstr as its LLM provider, making it an incredibly powerful tool for developers who want to move faster and focus on innovation.

### What you'll need:

*   VSCode installed
*   Code GPT or Roo Code VSCode extension
*   A Routstr account or a Cashu-compatible wallet
*   (Optional, for advanced automation) Codename Goose installed and configured.

## Getting Started with Routstr in VSCode

Integrating Routstr with your chosen VSCode extension is straightforward. The key is to obtain your Routstr API key or a Cashu token and configure it within the extension.

### Step 1: Obtain your Routstr API Key or Cashu Token

To use Routstr, you'll need either an API key from our chat application or a Cashu token generated from any Cashu-compatible wallet.

*   **Option A: Through the Routstr Chat App**
    *   Log in to your Routstr chat application.
    *   Navigate to the API key section (exact location may vary).
    *   Generate and copy your API key.

*   **Option B: Using a Cashu Wallet**
    *   If you prefer using Cashu, generate a Cashu token from your preferred Cashu wallet.
    *   Ensure the token is valid and has sufficient balance for your coding needs.

### Step 2: Configure Routstr in Your VSCode Extension

Once you have your API key or Cashu token, you'll add it to your VSCode extension's configuration.

#### For Code GPT (or similar extensions supporting OpenAI-compatible APIs):

Code GPT and many other AI coding extensions offer an option to use OpenAI-compatible APIs. This is where Routstr comes in.

1.  **Open VSCode Settings:** Go to `File > Preferences > Settings` (or `Code > Preferences > Settings` on macOS).
2.  **Search for Code GPT settings:** Type "Code GPT" in the search bar.
3.  **Select "OpenAI Compatible" as Provider:** Look for the "Provider" setting and choose "OpenAI Compatible" from the dropdown.

#### For Roo Code (or extensions supporting OpenRouter/Custom Providers):

Roo Code often has direct support for OpenRouter, which closely aligns with Routstr's functionality.

1.  **Open Roo Code Settings:** Access Roo Code settings through the VSCode settings or its dedicated panel.
2.  **Select "OpenRouter" or "Custom" as Provider:** Choose the appropriate provider option.

### Step 3: Start Coding with AI!

With Routstr configured, you can now start using the AI capabilities of your VSCode extension. Try generating code, asking for explanations, or refactoring existing code.

## Topping Up Your Routstr Balance

To ensure uninterrupted AI assistance, you'll need to top up your Routstr balance periodically.

*   **Option A: Through the Routstr Chat App**
    *   Log in to your Routstr chat application.
    *   Navigate to the "Top Up" or "Billing" section.
    *   Follow the instructions to add funds.

*   **Option B: Via the Routstr Top-Up Page**
    *   Visit the dedicated Routstr top-up page directly in your web browser.
    *   Enter the necessary details to complete your top-up.
