# Roo Code and Goose Shine when Coding with Freedom AI Tech

If using Cursor or Claude Code while billing it to your credit card is the gold standard for AI coding if you don't mind using your real identity and being spied upon, Roo Code and Goose plugging into Routstr is the gold standard if you are Satoshi and want to stay private. 

In this post, I'll guide you through the simple processing of setting up your coding enviroment with VSCode (+Roo Code), a terminal (+Goose) and Bitcoin with the help of Routstr.  

## Coding in VSCode with Roo Code
Before you open VSCode, create a cashu token worth 1.5k to 5k sats (recommended for top models) and have it ready(if you don't know how, checkout the section at the end of this article). Here is how you can get started: 
1. Install [Roo Code](https://roocode.com/) from the VSCode Extensions Marketplace. 
2. Choose OpenRouter as your API Provider (Routstr uses the same model names). 
3. For now, in the API Key field, just enter some random characters.

4. Once you're inside, click on the **default** mode and click **Edit**. 
5. Enable **custom base URL** and enter `https://api.routstr.com` in there. 
6. Now in the **API KeyÌ‹** field enter the Cashu token you created. ![screenshot](https://github.com/Routstr/content/blob/main/imgs/screenshot_2.jpg?raw=true)

**That's it! You can start coding!**

## Using Goose with Routstr
Hope you have a cashu token (check out the next section if not) and proceed:
1. Download Goose for your device from [here](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/getting-started/installation). 
2. It's easier on Goose. Choose **OpenAI Compatible** as the provider. 
3. Enter `https://api.routstr.com` as the base URL. 
4. Enter your cashu token as the API key. 
5. Choose a model as it automatically fetches from the API. 

**That's it! You can now create Freedom Agents!**

## No Emails, No Sign-ups, Just Cashu & Lightning
You can use any of the top LLMs via Routstr by inputting https://api.routstr.com/ and an API Key into Roo Code or Goose. Similar to using it via OpenRouter minus the need to sign up using email or having to top up using Fiat or the Coinbase chain. Here are the steps in more details: 
(Skip to step 4 if you already have a cashu wallet)
1. Setup a Cashu wallet (cashu.me or others)
2. Deposit some sats using Bitcoin Lightning (at least 5k sats for top models)
3. Create a cashu token (at least 5k sats, but 10 sats is also fine if you want to use 8b models)
4. Voila! That's it. Your cashu token is your API key. 
Lastly, here's how you can top up your Cashu token and also manage your API Keys in a more organized manner.

## Topup and Key Management
I've been using Roo Code and Goose via Routstr for a while now. The best way to keep track of all the cashu tokens and api keys has been the chat app we have [here](https://chat.routstr.com). Here's how: 
1. Login into the chat app (chat.routstr.com) using your Nostr extension or create a new nsec just for this. 
2. Deposit some sats using Lightning or Cashu into the NIP60 wallet we have. (if you already have a NIP60 wallet attached to your Nostr pubkey, it should show up)
3. Go to the API keys section and create API keys that are encrypted and synced to Nostr relays using NIP44. 
4. Be sure to backup your nsec if you just created it as your wallet balance and api keys are attached to that private key.

If you don't want to use the chat app and just want a way to topup your current Cashu token to avoid creating one every now and then, you can use our topup interface [here](https://routstr.com/topup).
