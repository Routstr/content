# Roo Code and Goose Shine in Coding with Freedom Tech

Welcome to the future of coding! This guide will walk you through integrating Routstr, an AI API provider, with your favorite VSCode extensions â€“ specifically, we'll focus on extensions like Code GPT and Roo Code that enable AI-powered development.

## Why Routstr?

Routstr offers a seamless way to access various AI models, similar to OpenRouter, allowing you to leverage cutting-edge AI directly within your development environment. Whether you're generating code, seeking explanations, or refining your logic, Routstr empowers you with intelligent assistance.

### What you'll need:

*   VSCode installed
*   Roo Code or Cline VSCode extension

## Getting Started with Routstr in VSCode

Integrating Routstr with your chosen VSCode extension is straightforward. The key is to obtain your Routstr API key or a Cashu token and configure it within the extension.


### Step 1: Obtain your Routstr API Key or Cashu Token


To use Routstr, you'll need either an API key from our chat application or a Cashu token generated from any Cashu-compatible wallet.

*   **Option A: Through the Routstr Chat App**
    *   Log in to your Routstr chat application.
    *   Navigate to the API key section (exact location may vary).
    *   Generate and copy your API key.

### Step 2: Configure Routstr in Your VSCode Extension

Once you have your API key or Cashu token, you'll add it to your VSCode extension's configuration.

#### For Code GPT (or similar extensions supporting OpenAI-compatible APIs):

Code GPT and many other AI coding extensions offer an option to use OpenAI-compatible APIs. This is where Routstr comes in.

1.  **Open VSCode Settings:** Go to `File > Preferences > Settings` (or `Code > Preferences > Settings` on macOS).
2.  **Search for Code GPT settings:** Type "Code GPT" in the search bar.
3.  **Select "OpenAI Compatible" as Provider:** Look for the "Provider" setting and choose "OpenAI Compatible" from the dropdown.
